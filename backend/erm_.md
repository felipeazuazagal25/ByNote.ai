The improvements include:
  
1. Standardized entity naming (singular form)
2. Added proper attributes with data types for each entity
3. Removed placeholder text
4. Added meaningful relationship descriptions
5. Added common fields like created_at and updated_at
6. Added foreign key indicators (<<FK>>)
7. Improved many-to-many relationships for tags
8. Added proper data types for all fields
9. Organized relationships with comments for better readability
  
The ERD now better represents a typical note-taking application with:
- User management and authentication (User, Session)
- Project organization
- Notes and Tasks with proper attributes
- Tagging system
- Activity logging
  
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the diagram in more detail?
